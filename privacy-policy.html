                                                        <p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of any Site, or to any products or services sold or distributed by el patas or through its Site will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
                                                        <p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>
                                                        <p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent R. Craig Spitz, 2120 Harmony Grove Rd., Escondido, CA 92029. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes. The AAA's rules are available at
                                                            <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a> or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, el patas will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>

    <div class="definition">El Patas Hace parte de la tradición oral Colombiana. Muchas veces es asociado con el diablo. Pero, se trata de un ser que tiene el poder divino de cambiar su apariencia para cambiar su apariencia y librarse de quienes lo acosan pidiéndole predecir los demonios humanos. El Patas es una síntesis de todo: es la suma de la belleza, la sabiduría, la fealdad, la torpeza, la ignorancia, virtud, vicio, grandeza y miseria.
